# 먹어 (meogeo)

먹어 (pronounced "meogo" is what you say in Korean when your child should be eating (usually when they aren't). I had to make this app because my first grader wanted to goof off and not eat breakfast so I had ChatGPT make it while she was goofing off.

I used the most cringe photo of myself that I created using Stable Diffusion and recorded the sound with the Voice Memos app.

I used this prompt to create the app: https://chatgpt.com/share/a2c3f57d-2bd5-4fd6-9fbb-4184b157d6fd

I then uploaded the photo/sound into the Replit iPhone app (ezpz) and pasted the code in. Replit has a great UI that lets you upload files and create & commit to a GitHub repo https://replit.com/@jwsy/meogeo

I then went to GitHub (via Safari, not the app) and enabled pages. Source: https://jwsy.github.io/meogeo/

I added the ribbon later with https://codepo8.github.io/css-fork-on-github-ribbon/.
